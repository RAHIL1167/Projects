2) Detecting the emotions/sentiment using Deep Learning:

The idea of the project is to detect the emotions of person by using hand written text.

It is divided into 2 phases:

In the first phase, we covert the handwritten text to Digital format using Optical Character Recognition.

In the second phase, we use Natural Language Processing  techniques analyze the emotions of the person.

Technologies:

OpenCV
NLTK
Naïve bayes classifier
