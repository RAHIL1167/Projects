Incremental machine learning models, also known as online learning or streaming models, are algorithms that can learn and update their predictions in real-time as new data becomes available. Unlike traditional batch learning models that require the entire dataset to be present upfront for training, incremental models can adapt and improve their performance as data arrives sequentially or in small batches.

The key characteristic of incremental models is their ability to learn from new observations without retraining the entire model. They update their parameters or model structure incrementally, incorporating new data while retaining knowledge from previous data. This makes incremental models well-suited for scenarios where data streams continuously, and it may not be feasible or practical to train models from scratch each time new data arrives.

Here are a few examples of incremental machine learning models:

Online Gradient Descent:
Online gradient descent is a popular algorithm for incremental learning. 
It updates the model's parameters after each new observation by computing the gradient of the loss function with respect to the parameters. 
This allows the model to adapt to new data points and adjust its predictions accordingly.

Adaptive Learning Rate Methods:
These methods dynamically adjust the learning rate during the training process based on the characteristics of the data.
For example, the learning rate can be decreased if the model has already learned from similar instances, or increased if the data suggests significant changes in the underlying patterns.

Bayesian Updating: Bayesian methods update the model's beliefs or probabilities based on new evidence. These models start with an initial prior belief and update it using new data to obtain a posterior belief. As more data becomes available, the posterior belief gets refined, leading to more accurate predictions.

Ensemble Methods: 
Ensemble models, such as Online Random Forests or Online Boosting algorithms, combine multiple individual models and update them incrementally. 
New observations are used to update the weights or parameters of the ensemble, allowing it to adapt to changing data and improve its predictions over time.

Incremental machine learning models are particularly useful in scenarios where data is constantly evolving, such as real-time prediction systems,
online recommendation systems, or anomaly detection in streaming data. By continuously adapting to new observations, 
these models can provide up-to-date predictions and insights without the need for periodic retraining on the entire dataset.
